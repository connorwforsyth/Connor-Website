        <p>
          I‚Äôm a designer and technologist interested in design sprints, Lean UX,
          agile, web technology, user/dev experience, education and open source.
          I currently work as a service designer at{" "}
          <Link href="https://designit.com">Designit</Link> and as an academic
          tutor at{" "}
          <span>
            <Link href="https://sydney.edu.au">The University of Sydney</Link>
          </span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I‚Äôve worked across public and private sector industries,
          startups, local government councils, universities, utilities,
          non-profits, community groups and the events industry. I started my
          career in architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          After work, you‚Äôll find me chipping away at small web projects,
          bouldering, and brewing coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some would say my design process is a little unorthodox, however this
          is overshadowed by my eagnerness to build a positive impact on
          products, services and communtiies.
