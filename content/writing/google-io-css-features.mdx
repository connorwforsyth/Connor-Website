At Google I/O 2022, there were a number of CSS announcements that got me excited.

Particularly, a feature that enabled developers the ability to style applications according to the users operating system preferences. Within your system preferences, try changing your systems highlight color theme and watch the ui change.

<UIWrapper>
<button 
className="py-1 px-3 rounded-full border font-medium  border-black bg-[Highlight]"
>
<p>Button</p>
</button>
</UIWrapper>

Most likely, above, you are seeing a <span style={{color: "Highlight", fontWeight: ""}}>blue button</span>.


```tsx 
<button 
className="py-1 px-3 rounded-full border font-medium border-black bg-[Highlight]"
>
Button
</button>
```
