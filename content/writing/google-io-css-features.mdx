At Google I/O 2022, there were a number of CSS announcements that got me excited.

Particularly, a feature that enabled developers the ability to style applications according to the users operating system preferences.

<UIWrapper>
<button 
className="py-1 px-3 rounded-full border font-medium  border-black bg-[Highlight]"
>
Button
</button>
</UIWrapper>

Most likely, above, you are seeing a <span style={{color: "Highlight", fontWeight: ""}}>blue button</span>.


```tsx 
<button 
className="py-1 px-3 rounded-full border font-medium border-black bg-[Highlight]"
>
Button
</button>
```
