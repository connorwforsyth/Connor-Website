## Project 1

### A new website for a new era.

In 2019, TEDxMelbourne's website was in an unusable state, with bugs, unclear development standards, and broad usability issues. We redesigned and redeveloped the website from the ground up to provide a better experience for our audiences.

### Insights and Opportunities

Building a website from the ground up enabled us to rethink the architecture of the site. The previous website had a basic CMS structure, but its use varied throughout the course of activity.

Areas to improve that are critical to users were:

-  The event purchasing process
-  The information and richness of the blog experience
-  General information regarding TEDxMelbourne Organization
-  The volunteer and speaker application experiences
-  Web Accessibility

## Project 2

### TEDxMelbourne United: An hybrid event experience to reconnect the artists of the TEDxMelbourne

**Overview:**

In late 2020, TEDxMelbourne introduced a new experience for our community that celebrates the creative and artistic aspects. This event aimed to reconnect the artists of TEDxMelbourne.

**Role:**

-  UI/UI Design and Development
-  Technical Support and Coordination
-  Art Direction Partner

**Outcomes:**

This event introduced our artist pass engagement, an ambitious audience interaction that involved our audience in creating user-generated content. The event also delivered an engaging live experience to both the in-person and online audiences.

### Design

**Insights:**

Through preliminary research done by focus groups with consultancy Prime Motive, the TEDxMelbourne audience desires authentic interactions and collaboration in sharing their own TEDx story or message.

**Solutions:**

-  Creating an event that’s central to cultural features of Melbourne, music, arts, creativity.
-  Providing an alternative platform for our audience to express themselves through TEDxMelbourne.
-  Creating a frictionless experience for artists to receive free access to our event while also getting a platform for themselves to share their art.

**Challenges:**

-  Designing and delivering a hybrid (in-person and virtual) music festival.
-  Building a platform and workflow for parsing and optimizing user-generated content.
-  Coordinating secure access for paid online events.

### Outcomes

**Outcomes for the organization:**

-  The artist pass catalog accounted for 8% of total unique page views across the TEDxMelbourne domain during Q1 of 2021, and the website saw a website viewership increase of 16%.
-  The organization gained strengths in experimentation, which has led us to push events further.

**Outcomes for users:**

-  The event introduced new ways to engage with TEDxMelbourne and have a platform to be heard.
-  Participants from around the world had the ability to engage with TEDxMelbourne in a more authentic way than ever.
