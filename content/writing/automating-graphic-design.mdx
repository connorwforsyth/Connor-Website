## Automating graphic design with integromat, google slides, airtable and more.

**An experiment with low code.**

Low-code is somewhat of a passion of mine, I'm always looking for ways to opportunities to create frictionless workflows for myself and my teams.


**Note:** This video walkthrough is unscripted and was created to help someone in the Airtable community solve a similar problem.


## Tools:

Adobe Photoshop, Integromat, Gmail, Google G-Suite, TinyPNG, Cloud Convert, Airtable. Webflow, Rebrandly.


This scenario created with a [TEDxMelbourne](/projects/tedxmelbourne) project involving user generated content.

I created this video using [Open Broadcast Studio](https://obsproject.com/).
