I've recently been experimenting with print media queries CSS and I learned that CSS actually supports milimeter units, to explore this I wrote an A4 page codepen to test it out and practice writing.

While print queries isn't setup on the following codepen, [they are on here](../cv).

It's worth mentioning that if you take a ruler up to the screen, you're unlikely to see real world measurements, due to how screens and pixels handle measurements differently. But if you're printing to a PDF or printer, the units will be relative to the physical size of the paper.
