A project during 2021 lockdown where I aimed to document my and share my konwledge on Coffee. The project uses Vuepress as a documentation solution and is deployed through Vercel.


It was initially created as a concept to try and share our knowledge of coffee between friends, evolving this further is still an idea thats bubbling away.

Inspiration came from James Hoffmans's book [The World Coffee Atlas](https://www.amazon.com.au/World-Atlas-Coffee-explored-explained/dp/1784724297), and resources from [Code Black Coffee](https://codeblackcoffee.com.au/)
