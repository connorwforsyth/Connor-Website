_Craft over Case Studies_

Design portfolios can be a burden to maintain and stay up to date, my goal for this portfolio update `2024` has been to establish _a personal space_ on the internet—a corner for continuous exploration and consistent updates. — It's nice to have you here.

To view case studies and projects, visit [projects](/projects).  
To learn more about me and my craft, visit [writings](./).


_Built with Next 14.1, ContentLayer, RadixUI, Shadcn, and TailwindCSS.   
Authentication set up with NextJS server actions and iron-session. Deployed with Vercel._
