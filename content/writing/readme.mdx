_Craft over Case Studies_

Maintaining a design portfolio can be challenging. In 2024 I decided to reframe my portfolio approach by using a markdown-based content system with minimal styling.

This website is my _personal space_ on the internet. A corner to share experiments, stories, and works in progress freely, without worrying about completion or perfectionism.

To view case studies and projects, visit [projects](/projects).  
To learn more about me and my craft, visit [writing](/writing).  
If you wish, you can view and fork this website's [source code](https://github.com/connorwforsyth/Connor-Website).



_Built with Next 14.1, ContentLayer, RadixUI, Shadcn, and TailwindCSS.   
Authentication set up with NextJS server actions and iron-session. Deployed with Vercel._
