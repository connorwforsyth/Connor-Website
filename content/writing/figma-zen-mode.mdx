Recently I've felt like UI's have been getting in the way of my creative flow. Particularly while working on devices with small screen sizes.

Reaching for buttons within an interface often requires moving my hands away from the keyboard to phyisically use my mouse and apply several clicks to achieve a desired action.

Figma does a great job with keyboard shortcuts, but could it be doing more?

This is where `figma-zen-mode` comes in.

<Comment text={`Inspired by VIM and zen-mode within VS Code`}> Figma-zen-mode</Comment> builds upon the existing hide-ui shortcut and introduces a command based workflow in Figma.

## Why a command based workflow?

Command based interaction patterns has risen in popularity in recent years, particularly for advanced users. — Those who use the tool day in and day out. 

General reports speak to command base workflows providing a reduction in context switching:

</div>
You can see implementations of this in tools like [Webflow](webflow.com), [Linear](linear.app), [Miro](miro.com) and of course [Raycast](raycast.com). Many of these are using Paco Coursey's [⌘K](https://cmdk.paco.me/) under the hood.

Command based workflows undoubtably are a timesaver for advanced users, and a reduction in context switching. I hope to see something like this implemented in more tools, particularly ones that I use on a daily basis.
