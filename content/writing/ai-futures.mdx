In 2023, I contributed to an internal speculative design project with Designit that examined AI's potential future influence on human-computer interaction.

Our research, not yet public, explored how LLMs would introduce a new category of hyper-specialised products that may only exist as a backend, but would be orchestrated through a marketplace, and accessed through centralised user interfaces.

These user-interfaces would enable users to traverse multiple service providers by *pecifying an intended outcome[^1] through a single user-interface. This interface would then orchestrate interactions with the hyper-specialised product marketplace.

This research opened up internal discussions around the impact on how a user's preference and patterns might influence this interface.

Everyone's unique form of interaction may become highly personalised, not only because of the services they access, but by the patterns in which they interact with the interface.

And how overtime, the interface may adapt to preferences and patterns of each user.

As the interface learns user preferences and patterns, it would create greater abstractions.

Through these abstractions and 'broad strokes' of the interface, the need and reliance on the interface would become less and less relevant, rendering it more invisible.

This concept excited our team as it meant that human's could ironically spend less time interacting with machines and more time connecting with the world and life itself.

Internally we referred to this concept as 'Headless Interfaces' inspired by concepts like JAMStack and headless cms technology.
