Miro is an incredible tool that we use throughout the design process, whether for presentations, concept testing, project managenement, or tracking or documenting user research.
 
The problem, is the the open canvas means that a lot of people end up structuring and documenting their miro boards in different ways. This increases cognifive load for team members, as well as workshop participants.

## Introducting the Design System
The design system for miro, started as a way for our team to create a consistent standard for miro board documentation to be shared across the organisation and throughout our projects.

It eventually evolved into a global resource that our organisation would turn to when looking up resources and stanrdards for how workshops should be run.
