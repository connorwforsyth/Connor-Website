title: A design system for Miro workshops
description: At Designit, we use Miro throughout the design process. Through this, we've developed some strategies to get the best use out of Miro. These strategies have formed a system of templates, principles, and primitives that we call the Miro Design System, ultimately helping our teams create Miro experiences with clarity and consistency.

## Context
At Designit, we use Miro throughout the design process, such as tracking and documenting user research, running workshops, project management, concept testing, and presentations. 

Due to the freeform and flexible canvas, we found that individuals and teams often leverage their own strategies and approaches to structure Miro boards for clarity and consistency. These strategies would often be developed organically with out a central source of truth, and reusing content across boards would often be a challenge due to sizing differences, font styles etc.

A specific challenge we were hoping to address was:

```md
- How can we reduce cognitive load for participants while collaborating in an unfamiliar tool?
```

As designers, our goal is always to make experiences more valuable and useful. If our process for collaborating is not user-friendly, then we're likely not capturing the full value of research and insight.

I found interest in this challenge and began to explore and document some of the strategies that I had been observing and using across the organisation. This began as a personal passion project, but quickly grew into a a series of living boards that our organisation would turn to when working and building boards in Miro.

## Introducing the Design System

The design system for Miro started as a way for our team to create a consistent standard for Miro board documentation to be shared across the organization and throughout our projects.

It eventually evolved into a global resource that our organization would turn to when looking up resources and standards for how workshops should be run.
