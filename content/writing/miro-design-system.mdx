Miro is an incredible tool that we use throughout the design process, whether
for presentations, concept testing, project management, or tracking and
documenting user research. The problem is that the open canvas means that a lot
of people end up structuring and documenting their Miro boards in different
ways. This increases cognitive load for team members, as well as workshop
participants.

## Introducing the Design System

The design system for Miro started as a way for our team to create a consistent standard for Miro board documentation to be shared across the organization and throughout our projects.

It eventually evolved into a global resource that our organization would turn to when looking up resources and standards for how workshops should be run.
