## A hybrid event experience to reconnect artists of the TEDxMelbourne community

The aim was to create an engaging experience for both online and in-person attendees.

This event also introduced an ambitious audience interaction â€” the _Artist Pass_. This offered artists the opportunity to share their music and art as part of the event curation and marketing collateral.

## Background

Through preliminary audience research with focus groups conducted in partnership with [Prime Motive](https://primemotive.com.au/), we learned that the TEDxMelbourne community value seeing everyday Melburnians celebrated on the TEDxMelbourne stage.

Furthermore, we learned that the TEDxMelbourne audience wants more events that showcase the cultural features of Melbourne, such as music, arts and creativity.

## Challenge

- We embarked on an event concept that placed Melbourne artists as the central focus.
- Given the uncertainty of events at the time, this event would be positioned to be hybrid. Making it accessible to audiences in-person and online.
- To celebrate the Melbourne community, we created the Artist Pass, giving artists free access to be part of the event and a platform to share their art.




## Event Blueprint

What our team had proposed was ambitious for a fully volunteer team to deliver. The technology and streaming capabilities was also something that few in our team had addressed before. In order to prototyping and walkthrough the event ahead of time, we produced a detailed service blueprint[^1].

## Hybrid event design

The design of the event required experimentation and collaboration between team members. This space was new for most of us however we were up for the challenge.

We created a custom access screen to protect page access. Thanks <Person name="Angie Kitono" /> for the amazing branding work for this event. This was one of the first event where the art direction was shared across all platforms.

We initially made some mockups of what we believed the in-page experience could be like, complete with the [Artist Pass](http://tedxmelbourne.com/music-salon/artist-catalogue) gallery.

Throughout 2020, we learned that audience interaction was a key value point for our events. Hence we paid particular attention to where the live chat would be positioned on the webpage.

### User generated content

Creating a system for handling user generated content at scale was a challenge of journey mapping and web development, requiring rigorous testing and coordination.

The solution meant that artists could easily submit a profile and once approved, would immediately appear on our site.


The high level process involved:
1. User uploads their artist information to a web form.
2. Information is approved manually, to ensure quality of applicants.
3. The information is then piped through a series of APIs to optimise the image and to create sharable social assets.
4. The information is pushed through to Webflow's CMS.
5. The user recieves an automated message with a unique sharable link to their webpage.

### Web application API Journey for User Generated Content

The following scenario was built with Integromat. [Watch Video Walkthrough](/writing/automating-graphic-design)

  src="/images/Intergromat-workflow.png"
/>
<br/>
Leveraging Integromat for low-code automations to connect APIs enabled us to build a CRUD app for Webflow CMS. This experiment pushed the boundaries of low-code development. One highlight was automating graphic design asset creation, like opengraph images, using Google Slides's API. I had hoped Canva had a public API, but it seemed unavailable then.

## Learnings

The design of the event required experimentation and collaboration between team members. This space was new for most of us however we were up for the challenge.

The activity of service blueprinting allowed us to test and answer questions around aspects of the event ahead of the event launch.

## Outcomes

**Outcomes for the organisation:**
- The artist pass catalog accounted for 8% of total unique page views across the TEDxMelbourne domain during Q1 of 2021, and the website saw a website viewership increase of 16%.
- The organization gained strengths in experimentation, which has led us to push events further.

**Outcomes for users:**
- The event introduced new ways to engage with TEDxMelbourne and have a platform to be heard.
- Participants from around the world had the ability to engage with TEDxMelbourne in a more authentic way than ever before.



[^1]: A service blueprint is a form of journey mapping that illustrates interactions occurring along a linear timeline. The defining characteristic and primary purpose of service blueprints is to visualize interactions that are occurring for the customer experience as well as for the employee experience. This is commonly referred to as "Back of House" and "Front of House" interactions.
