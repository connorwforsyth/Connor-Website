title: "TEDxMelbourne: Hybrid Event Experiences"
date: 2020-12-07
description: In late 2020, TEDxMelbourne wanted to introduce an event that celebrates the creative and artistic individuals of our community.
---

The aim was to create an engaging experience for both online and in-person attendees.

This event also introduced an ambitious audience interaction — Artist Pass. This offered artists the chance to be shared on our website and event marketing collateral.

### Background

- Through preliminary research done by focus groups with consultancy Prime Motive, the TEDxMelbourne audience desire authentic interactions and collaboration with sharing their own TEDx story or message. Not everyone can be a speaker. But there can be other ways of expressing this.

### Solutions

- Creating an event that’s central to cultural features of Melbourne, music, Arts, Creativity.
- Providing an alternative platform for our audience to express themselves through TEDxMelbourne.
- Creating a frictionless experience for artists to receive free access to our event while also getting a platform for themselves to share their art.

### Challenges

- Designing and delivering a hybrid (in-person and virtual) music festival.
- Building a platform and workflow for parsing and optimizing user generated content.
- Coordinating a secure access for paid online events.

## Prototyping

### User generated content

Creating a system for handling user generated content at scale was a challenge of journey mapping and web development, requiring rigorous testing and coordination. The solution meant that artists could easily submit a profile and once approved, would immediately appear on our site.

### Web application API Journey for User Generated Content

The following scenario was built with Integromat. [Watch Video Walkthrough](/writing/automating-graphic-design)

/>

Integromat allowed us to integrate various apps and flows using APIs. Allowing for app like interaction within a low-code environment. If you’re curious to learn more about what is happening in the above, watch my video that talks through it.


## Hybrid event design

The design of the event required experimentation and collaboration between team members. This space was new for most of us however we were up for the challenge.

## Learnings

The design of the event required experimentation and collaboration between team members. This space was new for most of us however we were up for the challenge.

To unpack and understand what would be required to run this event, we steps through every part of the event delivery in the form of a service blueprint.

The process of mapping the journey allowed us to test and question aspects of the event, well ahead of the event launch.

## Outcomes

**Outcomes for the organization:**

- The artist pass catalog accounted for 8% of total unique page views across the TEDxMelbourne domain during Q1 of 2021, and the website saw a website viewership increase of 16%.
- The organization gained strengths in experimentation, which has led us to push events further.

**Outcomes for users:**

- The event introduced new ways to engage with TEDxMelbourne and have a platform to be heard.
- Participants from around the world had the ability to engage with TEDxMelbourne in a more authentic way than ever.
