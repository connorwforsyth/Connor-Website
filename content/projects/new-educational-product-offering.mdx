## Background:

The University of Sydney is one of the top universities in Sydney, Australia, and is ranked in the top 20 universities in the world.

## Challenge
The university has witnessessed a decline in the demand for traditional full-time on-campus study among domestic postgraduates. 

Increasingly, domestic postgraduates are opting for shorter, more focused alternatives, such as non-award programs and micro-credentials.

In response to this, the University has developed a new educational offering called the Adaptive Learning Ecosystem (ALE). Its vision is to empower prospective students to enhance their skills and advance their careers in a more flexible and cost-effective manner through the use of micro-credentials.

## The ask

> Sydney University collaborated with Designit to transform the vision for the ALE into a clearly defined product offering, and to validate market fit for operationalisation.


## Approach
The first six weeks were spent envisioning and designing the ALE learning experience:
We engaged 12 University stakeholders, ran six in-person workshops, and co-created 18 concepts that we used to test comprehension and desirability with 11 end users in 60-minute one-on-one qualitative interviews.

The insights informed the product concept and design of a prototype, and used as stimuli in 15 one-on-one qualitative interviews to test consumer engagement, expectations as well as elements required to successfully operationalise the ALE model in-market.

Total duration of engagement was 10 weeks.

- In order to get the stakeholders across the background research, we adopted an educational practice known as a gallery walk[^1].
- Using this technique allowed us to learn what questions the stakeholders had for the source material, and what was important to them.
- We then collated some of the key questions from the gallery walk to define key research questions for the cohorts in question.
- The second workshop involved defining the Job Map[^2] and key functional, social and emotional jobs[^3].
- We conducted two rounds of concept testing with different stakeholder groups. We always push for rounds of iteration testing within these projects in order to further validate and iterate the design.

## Outcome

- **Market-fit analysis** and product vision that was anchored in qualitative insights. 

- **A comprehensive research report** detailing desirability and comprehension of the ALE as well as prospective students' educational, emotional, functional and social needs provide key stakeholders a solid foundation to make decisions and progress with the ALE – specifically in relation to gain funding and to communicate with teams across the University. 

- **Three distinct opportunities** were uncovered as well as three key impact areas that specifically target the [increased] likelihood of purchase and return purchase.


## Impact

### Clear product vision
By establishing a clear vision for the ALE experience, the University can move forward with confidence and momentum.

### Connected user experience
The research provides valuable insights into the target market and what prospective students truly value. Addressing barriers and aligning the experience with expectations and needs further emphasise the importance of taking a human centric approach to design. 

### Increased engagement
Delivering an experience that matters to the target audience and effectively marketing the ALE leads to greater engagement and enrolment rates. This not only attracts more students but also improves their satisfaction with the learning experience.


## Learnings
- The project involved navigating perspectives from the clients leadership team, many of whom had contracting views on what the product offer should be.
- The regular in-person workshops enabled us to build strong personable relationships with the clients team. Something that we miss in the remote nature of our work.
- The project involved navigating and communicating complexity.

## Reflections 

Some of the person reflections that I had for the project were to:
1. Pay attention to the brief and consistently give perspective on the challenge at hand.
2. Identify who’s most likely going to take the project ahead after you hand over and what their needs might be. Collaborate with them early in the process to understand their needs.
3. Sometimes, visionaries just need to see their vision. The complexity of the product extended into the minds of our clients. It was up to us to conceptualise their idea, put it in front of them, in order for them to either understand or tell us what wasn’t right.

## Acknowledgements
I wanted to thank Madeleine Frick for leadership through this project, and her relentless curiosity; Sheree Hannah for excellent UI work; And Amelia Campbell for great report writing and user interview skills. And last but not least Sydney University.

[^1]: A gallery walk is an educational practice in which participants will walk through a 'gallery' of information and write on post-its, information that stood out, or questions that they have for the content.

[^2]: The Job Map is one of the foundational tools within the JTBD framework. The framework typically defines 8 main steps within a customer job. In our case, we included some prompts to help guide the participants such as ‘I wish’, ‘I wonder’, ‘I’m unsure about...’

[^3]: Functional, social and emotional jobs are different types of jobs a customer might want solved through purchasing a product. for more on Jobs to be Done, see [Strategiser]()].
