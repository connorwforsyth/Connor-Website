## Overview

I'm often building workshop templates and components for our teams at [Designit](https://designit.com) to improve the way they run and facilitate workshops.

A big part of this is ensuring consistency and reducing cognitive load for workshop participants and facilitators. Hence I've paid close attention to using consistent spacing to improve the clarity of experience. A lot of this has been done within our remote workshop tool of choice, [Miro](https://miro.com).

I may end up creating a Miro plugin as well, but for now, using SVGs enables the elements to be copied and placed in other programs such as Figma.
