>Which project are you most proud of?

Whenever I get asked this question, whether I believe it or not — I can't help but think of this project.
{/* 
I smile, then try to come up with a project that's more recent. */}

The following 10+ years old footage may be all that's left from it, and apart from being iPhone 4 footage propped up on a paper cup, it represents an early moment in my design journey of the joy from creating something novel.

### Project Overview

_Set design projection mapping of a live electronic music performance._

In my final year of high school, I was given the opportunity to create a brief to explore visual communication design. 

The concept was to create an immersive electronic music performance that combines visual lights, spatial form and music and video to create one cohesive artistic experience.

Through using DAWs like Ableton Live, a musician could feasibly design and operate their own lighting show fit for purpose with their music.

Furthermore, through using prefabricated flatpack, modular set pieces, projection mapping would be a cost effective way to deliver an immersive light show for various stage environments.

### Process 
Through research, sketching, 3D modeling, and various prototypes of spatial form, I created a laser cut scale model of my set, to be used for a projection mapping maquette.
I found a video projector, opened up an early version of Photoshop, set the aspect ratio of the projector to match the canvas, and attempted to start tracing my hand cut model of a set.

### Learnings
It was from projects like this—a blend of architectural design, interaction design, prototyping, and computing that led me down the path of studying architecture in university, eventually moving into user experience design, events management and programming.

{/* 
What this project represents to me, was a key moment in which I was totally immersed in the process of creating something.

It represents a time in which I knew not what I was doing, wasn't overly concerned with direction but only wanted to create something that made people open their eyes and say Wow.

It's also a project in which the creation process required true creativity and problem solving, no experts, only strong curiosity. */}

### Reflection

I have fond memories of the sleepless nights — the experiments, the discoveries, and witnessing the golden sun rising after driving to school before dawn with my classmates who similarly did not sleep while pushing their projects to their limits.

I hope others have experienced a similar moment of tasteful satisfaction through their craft.
