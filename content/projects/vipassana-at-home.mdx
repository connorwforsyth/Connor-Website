## Introducing an approachable mindfulness practice to a disconnected world through the pandemic.

_Timeline_

With a tight turn around, Vipassana at Home was conceptualised, designed and launched within a month.

_Role_

My role was to design and develop the end to end experience for the community, while supporting the facilitators to deliver daily mindfulness practices around the globe.

_Personal Challenges_

This was an opportunity to build a product from the ground up through moving fast in a small team. Our MVP allowed us to quickly get feedback from our users to validate the idea. Its since created other products and events.

## Inspiration
_Accessible introduction to mindfulness for everyday life._

The pandemic has shown us that people are willing to engage with online forms of personal growth and exploration. Self-improvement and new experiences are among some of the things people have been wanting to explore when isolated.

## Opportunities

As a co-creator of Vipassana at Home, we have firsthand experience of the value a practice of meditation can bring, and with our combined vision of facilitation and digital experience, we began speculating on how we could introduce the practice of vipassana to more people, particularly when isolated.

Furthermore, many people believe that taking 10 days out of their lives to participate in a traditional vipassana retreat is too much of a commitment. Our course hopes to become a stepping stone for those who want that first taste of a vipassana experience.

Introduce an approachable mindfulness practice to a world of busy and curious people.

Craft a course that introduces precepts to meditation.

The quick nature of this process meant that we were prototyping on the fly and coming up with new ideas throughout the process. Much of the development of the course itself was happening moments before testing with our customers.
This allowed us to learn fast and respond to challenges the community was experiencing.
