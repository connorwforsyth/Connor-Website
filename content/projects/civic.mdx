## Role

I was part of the in-house service design team at Civic Disability Services supporting solving organisational challenges across strategy, insights, and experience design.

The in-house service design role is one which grants freedom and autonomy to identify opportunities for innovation across the organisation. Various aspects of the role included project management, coaching and mentoring in agile methodologies, and facilitating workshops using design thinking.

## Key projects

-  Employee onboarding experience design research study
-  Coordinated with [Harness Projects](https://www.harnessprojects.com.au/) to deliver an advanced research study project with 20 students
-  Built communities of practice (CoPs) through fortnightly events and workshops.
-  Aggregation of marginal gains and 1% improvements
-  Client outcomes gap analysis
