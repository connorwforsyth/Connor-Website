title: A plugin for rolling up Figma components
description: While conducting a heuristic evaluation, I wanted to rollup information that was stored inside Figma component variables.
p2: I couldn't find a native way to do it in Figma, so I looked into creating a plugin.

In the past, such as for a [chatbot heuristic evaluation](./chatbot-heuristic) I've used a speadsheet tool like Notion or Google Sheets as a way to track and measure observations within a Heuristic Evaluation line by line.

However during an <Comment text="the project that kicked off this experiment">intranet project</Comment>, we used Figma to document the evaluation, as it enabled evaluators to take screenshots of the interfaces and directly markup the elements that were being analyzed.

# Figma Setup

We created some components to streamline our evaluation process. Ranging from useful utilities that we include in all projects such as status indicators thanks @<Person name="Lauren Conti"/>.

/>

The main goal was to create a component that could be used for data modelling. This involved nesting components within one another to create a consistent representation of the data.

Creating variants of the heuristic observation component enabled us to view the component in a card as well as a table format. This made it suitable for repurposing the Figma component to be shared in presentations or other activities like for affinity diagramming[^1].

## Benchmarking during an observation.

Typically when we do an evaluation, we find that it's useful to perform some basic data analysis to benchmark and summarise certain metrics or how often certain heuristics are arising and where.

**For example you may want to track:**

- The _average time_ evaluators took to complete a certain task on the interface.
- The _total count_ of certain heuristic issue within a specific page.
- The _average severity_ of heuristics across the entire evaluation.

### We often include a breakdown of these results at a glance:

/>

### The gotcha

The downside we faced when using Figma is that _you're not working with a
database_, so it's difficult to track information dynamically.

You can try your best by neatly structuring a page and visually get a sense of 'how much' you've made. You can try and `⌘F` search a term to see a count of how often the term occurs. But what happens if you delete a few elements? Or add a few more?

Ultimately, these options \*are not\* as reliable as a spreadsheet.

After checking with our resident figma expert <Person name="Lauren Conti"/> about what might be possible, and looking over potential figma component export plugins, I couldn't find any that specifically would solve my problem.

_So I started looking into figma plugins._

## Figma Plugins

I've never really been one to reach for a figma plugin to solve a specific problem, I try to get most of what I need to do with their build in features.

Don't get me wrong there are some great ones like [Sorter](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742038190980789811) that I often reach for.

However exporting component data I thought would be a useful thing to experiment with.

### Process

Figma have made it really easy to get started with plugins, within the figma application, they've created an awesome onboarding which helped me get started.

However I spent most of my time consulting the [Figma Developer Docs](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/plugin-quickstart-guide/) and Figma's [Build your first plugin](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407260620823--BYFP-1-Overview) video series.

<div className="mx-auto grid max-w-3xl gap-3 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Img
    className="aspect-auto lg:p-0"
    src="/projects/figma-plugin/walkthrough/step-1.png"
  />
  <Img
    className="aspect-auto  lg:p-0"
    src="/projects/figma-plugin/walkthrough/step-2.png"
  />
</div>

When you initialise the plugin template, you are greeted with several files including a `code.ts` file, a `code.js` file, a `manifest.json` file, and if you're using the ui template you'll also have a `ui.html`.

The figma plugin runs like a traditional webpage, so as you'd expect, the `code.js` file is just a compliled version of whatever is written in the `.ts` file.

### Building the logic

**My goals were to be able to:**

1. Make a selection of components I wanted to get data from
2. Click a button
3. See a readout of all the content within the components selected.

Accessing Figma's node is made simple through their global javascript object `figma`.

By entering `figma` into the browser console, it will reveal a variety of elements for you to interact with.

In our case, getting the current selected nodes.

`figma.currentPage.selection` will references the selected nodes as an array.

```json
// I've selected 4 component variables.
> figma.currentPage.selection (4)
[InstanceNode, InstanceNode, InstanceNode, InstanceNode] 0 : InstanceNode {id:
'512:7158'} 1 : InstanceNode {id: '512:7244'} 2 : InstanceNode {id: '512:7249'}
3 : InstanceNode {id: '512:7254'}
```

Step 1 complete ✅.

Now for the tricky part of accessing the child component information from the selection.

I realised you could loop through the selected nodes.

```ts showLineNumbers
// This prints how many component instances are selected.
const node = figma.currentPage.selection;
let totalInstances = 0;
let nonInstance = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < node.length; i++) {
  node[i];
  // Check if the selected item is a not instance.
  if (node[i].type === "INSTANCE") {
    totalInstances++;
    // initialise the recursive function.
    printChildNames(node[i]);
  } else {
    nonInstance++;
  }
}
console.log(
  `There are ${totalInstances} Component instances selected and ${nonInstances} non component instances  selected.`,
);
```

By unrapping the InstanceNodes, I found that if you go deep enough, you can access the name variable, and the the inner characters of the text nodes within those variables.

I used a recursive function, to check inside each of the instances within the selection array, and stored each occurance to a new json object.

```ts
let count = {};
// Recursive function to identify each of the variants and children.
function printChildNames(node: InstanceNode) {
  if ("children" in node) {
    for (let child of node.children) {
      // Characters is where I'm referencing the child component information.
      if ("characters" in child) {
        let text;
        // If the child.name === child.characters, is checking if the child boolean. Not a pefect solution. Still needs work.
        if (child.name === child.characters) {
          text = { [child.name]: true };
          if (child.name in count) {
            count[child.name]++;
          } else {
            count[child.name] = 1;
          }
        } else {
          text = { [child.name]: child.characters };
          if (child.name in count) {
            count[child.name]++;
          } else {
            count[child.name] = 1;
          }
        }
      }
      // Call printChildNames only for the current child.
      printChildNames(child as InstanceNode);
    }
  }
}
```

This was then referencing the count of children instances as new variables and could be printed to the console.

```ts
console.log(`The TOTAL component instances: ${totalInstances}. The COUNT OF variants is as follows: ${count}`;)
```

You can even play with a version of this in the console simply by selecting a component instance and pasting this in the console.

```
figma.currentPage.selection[0].children[0].name
```

### Adding a UI

At first I wasn't expecting to create a ui. But I thought it could be useful as a way to represent the print out after running the function.

Figma enables a basic ui through a `ui.html` file. You can initialise the plugin ui to open via the backend by running the command: `figma.showUI(__html__);`.

At first I was struggling to add styles to my ui, until I realised that the manifest.json restricts certain files from being accessed and compiled, such as .css files.

There are ways of getting past this in fact there's even a [figma plugin design system](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds) that [Thomas Lowry](https://github.com/thomas-lowry) created. However for my purposes decided to just add a `<style>` tag to my html.

```html
<!-- ui.html -->
<div class="p-3">
  <h1>Rollup Component Information</h1>

  <p>This plugin retrieves and consolidates component information.</p>

  <p class="mt-1"><strong>Select</strong> your components and click "Calculate".</p>

  <p>You will recieve a JSON representation of the data in your component.</p>

## Adding the printout to the figma interface

So far, the results from my `code.ts` was only printing the results to the console. I wanted this result to be printed to the ui. Figma has this handy function called `figma.showUI(<div>hello world!<div>);` which enables elements to be printed to the ui.

However while I was prototyping this out, I totally missed that function. So I attempted to get the plugin to actually create a figma text node.

This was the least fun part of the process. But I eventually came up with this:

```ts
// Render the result into a figma text node.
async function renderText(totalInstances: any, nonInstance: any, count: any) {
  await figma.loadFontAsync({
    family: "Inter",
    style: "Regular",
  });
  const nodes: SceneNode[] = [];
  let text = figma.createText();
  // Load the font in the text node before setting the characters
  text.characters = `The TOTAL component instances: ${totalInstances}. The COUNT OF variants is as follows: ${JSON.stringify(
    count,
  )}`;
  text.fontSize = 256;
  text.fills = [{ type: "SOLID", color: { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0 } }];
  nodes.push(text);
  console.log(count);
  figma.viewport.scrollAndZoomIntoView(nodes);
  figma.closePlugin();
}
```

This just drops a very large green chunk of text onto the screen. But at least the user can't miss it!
Soon, I'd love to revisit this plugin and rebuild the ui so the text doesn't render have to render into the figma canvas.

## Reflection

There's something so delightful about creating a simple tool to achieve a specific problem that you're facing. Even if it's not perfected.

I think extending a plugin like this could help many teams who are struggling to choose how to conduct a hueristic evaluation. Being intentional for how one set's up the component structure can also pay off in the long run.

  To quickly format the text I'm using an AI function that [I created using
  Raycast](https://twitter.com/connorwforsyth/status/1765161287754121316).

I'd encourage others to experiment with the figma plugin ecosystem. If anyone wants to check out the source code for this, [it's available on github](https://github.com/connorwforsyth/Rollup-Component-Instance).

Check out this post again in the future for potential updates.
