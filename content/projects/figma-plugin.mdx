title: A plugin for rolling up Figma components
description: While conducting a heuristic evaluation, I wanted to rollup information that was stored inside Figma component variables.

In the past, such as for a [chatbot heuristic evaluation](./chatbot-heuristic) I've used a speadsheet tool like Notion or Google Sheets as a way to track and measure observations within a Heuristic Evaluation line by line.

However during an <Comment text="the project that kicked off this experiment">intranet project</Comment>, we chose Figma to document the heuristic observations, as it enabled evaluators to take screenshots of the interfaces and directly markup the elements that were being analyzed.

## Benchmarking during an observation

The downside we faced for using Figma, is that we find that it's useful to benchmark and summarise how often certain heuristcs are arrising at a high level.

This is useful to track performance of certain pages, and to have a birds eye view of how many issues are occuring against a given heuristic. Or what the average severity is for a given page.
