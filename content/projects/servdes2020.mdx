## Overview:

Service Design and Innovation conference ([ServDes](https://servdes2020.org/)) is a premier international conference for exchanging knowledge within service design and innovation studies. aimed at both academics and industry practitioners.

## Role:

Supporting as an experience designer, I helped wayfind, prototype, and craft digital assets and integrate the seminar schedule into a virtual conference environment using [Gather.Town](https://gather.town).

This was an exciting opportunity to collaborate with various designers in an unfamiliar medium. The solution bridged the gap between seminar and workshop spaces within a hybrid interactive environment.



## Challenge

### A space for serendipitous interactions
The main objective for this space was to reintroduce opportunities for serendipitous interactions between conference attendees.

Feedback from previous events have noted that these interactions were where the most value is obtained for ServDes events. Our proposed space aimed to create a cohesive environment that matched with what the conference was delivering.

__Some of the challenges included:__
-  Seminars / Workshops happening at the same time.
-  Different runtimes for sessions, affecting how long we could allocate in the breakout spaces.
-  Themed seminars.
-  Q&A sessions with the location occurring within Gather.Town.

We created an initial wireframe for the environment which included enough rooms to accommodate overlapping workshops. 

Each workshop or seminar would have their own room in which they could host further discussion in scheduled hours using Gather.Town.
