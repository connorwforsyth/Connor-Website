## Overview:

Service Design and Innovation conference (ServDes.) is the premier international research conference for exchanging knowledge within service design and service innovation studies aimed at both academics and industry practitioners.

## Role:

Supporting as an experience designer, I helped wayfind, prototype, and craft digital assets and integrate the seminar schedule into a virtual conference environment using Gather.Town.

This was an exciting opportunity to collaborate with various designers in an unfamiliar medium. The solution bridged the gap between seminar and workshop spaces with an interactive environment.



## Design

### A space for serendipitous interactions
The main objective for this space was to reintroduce opportunities for serendipitous interactions between conference attendees.

Feedback from previous events have noted that this is part of where the most value is obtained for ServDes events. Our proposed space aimed to create a cohesive environment that matched with what the conference was delivering.

Some of the challenges included:
-  Seminars / Workshops happening at the same time.
-  Different runtimes for sessions, affecting how long we could allocate in the breakout spaces.
-  Themed seminars.
-  Q and A sessions with the location occurring within gathertown.

We created an initial wireframe for the environment which included enough rooms to accommodate overlapping workshops. Each workshop or seminar would have their own room in which they could host further discussion in scheduled hours using the Gather.Town environment.

### Interactions
The 8-bit game-like space created cool interactions. It was a blast to break into some adobe illustrator filters to create these 3D icons.

-  Placemaking through landmarks and interactive elements.
-  Serendipitous conversation prompts in-between spaces.
-  Central Map as you enter acting as an *oracle*.
-  Wayfinding through immersive 8-bit graphics.
-  Interactive Room schedules that link to the seminar schedule for the room.
-  Feedback Board for Gather feedback and feature requests.

### Outcomes
-  The solution created opportunities for attendees to interact casually throughout the conference. While being a secondary feature of what brought people to the events.
-  It allowed for attendees across the road to interact in a casual setting using an inspiring tool. This showed many attendees within the conference that it is possible.
