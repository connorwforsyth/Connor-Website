## Overview
Woolworths is the leading grocery supplier in Australia serving millions of Australians daily. They've invested heavily into digital experiences and e-commerce, now servicing many customers through their digital channels.



## Challenge

<Img className="max-w-2xl items-end bg-[#3BBA38] dark:bg-[#3BBA38] p-0 lg:p-0" ImgClassName="object-scale-down" src="/projects/woolies-chat/olive.png"/>
WooliesX, Woolworths's digital capability, operates a suite of chatbots that collectively handle 10,000 conversations per day across multiple brands and e-commerce sites.

This conversation UI is an important component of Woolies' digital customer service strategy. However, to date, they have found it difficult to increase user adoption and enable more opportunities for self-service.

> WooliesX engaged Designit to help evaluate the performance of these chatbots and identify areas where customer service interaction could be improved.

## Our Process

- We conducting a heurstic evaluation of critical user tasks across three chatbots.
- We benchmarked the chatbot tasks against chosen metrics and hueristics.
- Based on customer service data and through collaborative workshops, we worked with the client to prioritise which user tasks were critical to get right to deliver a great customer experience.


### Conversation design

To get our heads around how we would best conduct our analysis, we leveraged principles conversation design[^1]. 

As part of this, we reviewed studies from the likes of [Erika Hall](https://abookapart.com/products/conversation-design), [Diana Deibel](https://twitter.com/dianadoesthis) and [Rebecca Evanhoe](https://twitter.com/revanhoe).

#### Utterances and intents
We approached the heuristic evaluation through a task based lens. In conversation design, tasks are commonly reffered to as Intents[^2], not to confused with utterances[^3].

### Chosen Heuristics

A heuristic[^4] evaluation isn't commonly used for evaluating the usability of a chatbot. Nevertheless, we were able to adopt a suitable evaluation in line with how we would typically benchmark an interface.

We leveraged a combination of [NN/g principles](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) as well as [Tog's List](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/first-principles-of-interaction-design) of First principles of interaction to arrive at our chosen heuristics.

| Metrics | Heuristics | 
| --- | --- |
| Time on tasks (Seconds)<br/>Severity (0-1-2-3)<br/> Task Completion (0-1-2) | - Match between the system and the real world <br/> - Findability and Discoverability <br/> - Recognition rather than recall <br /> - Aesthetics and Minimalist Design|


### Conducting the heuristic evaluation

To conduct and document the evaluation, our team used a combination of Notion databases and Loom to screen record each time we conducted a test.

Three of us ran the evaluation to minimize bias and obtain a range of data for the test results.

Using templated databases within Notion enabled us to setup a consistent testing file of which was linked back to master databases.

This also meant that we could roll up the results from each test to do some high-level summarization of each of the intents, heuristics, and severity.

### Deliverables:
In total, we evaluated six key journeys across three different chatbots.

We provided a report outlining key findings, recommendations,  best-in-class examples, and design explorations. 

Additionally, we delivered the heuristic evaluation as a raw csv data, suitable for the client to upload into their backlog and start working with them in their agile teams.

## Learnings

This was my first deep dive into conversation design. Reflecting on the current state of interaction, conversation design is only becoming more important through the advancements of language based interfaces.

This project was rewarding as it enabled us to focus deeply on the needs and intents of the user. In some projects, lots of content and workshops get in the way of just focusing and designing for the task at hand.

## Acknowledgement

Huge thanks to <Person name="Andrew Barrie"/> for the mentoring and leadership through this project. And thank you for allowing our project team to test our Notion as a way to structure the heuristic analysis.

[^1]: Conversation design is a design language based on human conversation. The more an interface leverages human conversation, the less users have to be taught how to use it. It‚Äôs a synthesis of several design disciplines, including voice user interface design, interaction design, visual design, motion design, audio design, and UX writing. ([Source](https://arc.net/l/quote/owkczxyp))

[^2]: __Intent__ describes the types of requests people have, or tasks they want to do.

[^3]: __Utterance__ can be thought of as _query_, which refers to what a user says to make such a request, whether it's a specific word, phrase, or full sentence.

[^4]:Put simply, they are recognised usability principles Heuristics help us identify and categorise usability problems found within the design of a digital product. We examine the product and assess it against a chosen set of heuristics.
