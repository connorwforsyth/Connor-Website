## Overview

Through a four-day product concept sprint, I designed an early prototype of the ReciMe homepage suitable for users of desktop web interfaces.

This helped establish the start of the overall navigational elements, a design system, and component library for their web application.

## Process

Over the course of four days, I focused on:

1. Getting aquanted with the product, iOS UI, potential user groups and core customer jobs.
2. Using my understanding to produce an desktop concept of what the web application experience could be.

The intention would be to use this concept to align with ReciMe's view of their product strategy, and to take it to testing with different users groups.

## Tasks involved:

- App audit, screens, flows, tasks.
- Understanding compeditors.
- Battle testing core user tasks, including:
  1. Finding a recipe
  2. Organising groceries
  3. Creating a recipe from either importing or from scratch
  4. Searching ingredients and recipes
  5. Leaving reviews on recipes.
```

## Learnings from discovery

### 1. Core task for users accessing the app for the first time

The metaphor for `Homepage` is unclear on the mobile app, currently seeming to be the `my recipes` section, which is unusual for most social media or content platforms. Users visiting the mobile app for the first time are greeted by an empty `my recipes` page.

<Comment text="Based on observation of people in the supermarket, testing with friends and colleagues over the course of a few days">Guerrilla user research</Comment> suggested that many users accessing a recipe app for the first time would like to browse available recipes.

Exploring and discovering recipes was hidden within the side menu. My immediate goal was to make finding recipes intuitive, easy, and following traditional patterns from familiar apps.

### 2. The experience of grocery shopping and cooking

Selecting a meal and adding it to my grocery list was straightforward. However, shopping at the supermarket took 30 minutes for a basic meal, likely due to the awkward process of ticking off items. A focused WatchOS app for grocery checklists could enable a more ergonomic experience.

For many users, cooking at home is financially motivated. After spending around $80, I felt compelled to track meal costs. With LLMs and OCR text readers, this feature is possible, and I wanted to hint at it in the app.

### 3. Importing a meal

Importing a recipe is a prominently advertised feature of ReciMe. I tested various sources including Instagram, TikTok, restaurant menus, meal photos, cookbooks, and recipe websites. Many import options didn't work as expected, suggesting it's still an experimental feature. I'd love to be able to reverse-engineer favorite restaurant meals.

## Design decisions:

- Bring recipe browsing and meal planning to the forefront for first-time users.
- Improve recipe ratings and distinguish between saved inspiration and reliable recipes.
- Draw inspiration from other platforms like Pinterest (saving pins), TikTok (short-form videos), and Spotify (playlists and cookbooks).
- Revamp UI elements and colors to improve accessibility and scalability, using a color system from radix-ui and a grid system for spacing and alignment.
- Refine the existing logo for added polish and delight.

## Outcomes and deliverables

The new web home screen for ReciMe grounds users in core tasks, enables easy browsing of trending recipes, and allows searching by meal type, ingredients, and cuisines. It also hints at new features like receipt scanning for financial tracking and meal cost prediction.
