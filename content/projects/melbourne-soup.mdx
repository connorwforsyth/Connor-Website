[MelbourneSOUP](https://www.linkedin.com/company/melbournesoup/) was an organisation in Melbourne that helped social enterprises gain their intiial rounds of funding in order to create change in their local community.

Due to an effort to increase impact, we created a resource to share our guided process for creating SOUP communities. This was initially created as a PDF but was later adapted into a Nextra Site.
