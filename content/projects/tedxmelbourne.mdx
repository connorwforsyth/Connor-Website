TEDxMelbourne has been a long-term platform and playground for my practice. I'm currently the _Design Technologist_ within operations.

In 2019, TEDxMelbourne's website was in an unusable state with bugs, unclear development standards, and broad usability issues. We redesigned and redeveloped the website from the ground up to provide a better experience for our audiences.
[Read more](https://www.tedxmelbourne.com/blog/new-website-new-era) about the TEDxMelbourne Website launch.


### Insights and Opportunities



Building a website from the ground up enabled us to rethink the architecture of the site. The previous website had a basic CMS structure, but its use varied throughout the course of activity.

Areas to improve that are critical to users were:

-  The event purchasing process
-  The information and richness of the blog experience
-  General information regarding TEDxMelbourne Organization
-  The volunteer and speaker application experiences
-  Web Accessibility


## Objectives

The development of the digital experience has been an iterative process over several years. The development of the new website was informed by these three principles.

### Creating a frictionless experience for attendees and organisers.

-  Custom CRM automations provide the user with instant automated feedback from requests such as volunteer, partner and speaker applications.
-  All new features integrate with existing tools informing organisers of the new requests in platforms that suit them best such as Trello or G-Suite.
- Automations also extend to operations team functions such as new volunteer onboarding.

### Support existing workflows
-  How can we bring more value to current activities that we provide?
-  How can our digital experience support operationally critical workflows for staff?


### Be adaptive and experiment.

-   During the pandemic, our team was pushed to come up with new ways of engaging with our audience which heavily relied on digital forms of interaction. This led us to experiment and develop experiences including but not limited to hybrid music festivals, regular [TED Circles](https://www.tedxmelbourne.com/event/designing-humanity), and events that featured user-generated content. These initiatives, particularly during a time of such disconnect, united the TEDxMelbourne community more than ever before.

## Website Features

### Redeveloped TEDx Talks experience
![Redesigned--tedxtalks-experience](/images/Redesigned--tedxtalks-experience.png)

TEDxMelbourne has a catalog of over 140 talks. Hence it was important for us to consider how a user could filter through these talks to find useful ones that they wanted to view. We leveraged [Finsweet's CMS filtering system](https://finsweet.com/attributes/cms-filter) to filter results on the search page.

As an experiment to make the website feel more bespoke and native, I developed a custom video player using [plyr.io](https://plyr.io).

<br />

__In development:__

We hope to add in-page, indexable video transcripts to each of the TEDxMelbourne Talks.


### About TEDxMelbourne and team recognition
![TEDxTeam-page](/images/TEDxTeam-page.png)

As a volunteer organisation, we aim to give as much recognition to the people behind TEDxMelbourne.

This also helps the audience, especially for those who are interested to join and get involved, understand the overall structure of TEDxMelbourne and the value that each team brings to the organisation.
{/* Potentially add something here relating to the goal of adding info about recruitment challenges */}

### Integrations with event platforms
![eventbrite-feature-1](/images/eventbrite-feature-1.svg)

TEDxMelbourne has used Eventbrite as our ticketing plaform for over 10 years. Using Eventbrite's public API, our team was able to integrate and push events to the website's content management system.

### User experience and event accessibility
![accessibility-feature-tedx](/images/accessibility-feature-tedx.png)


TEDxMelbourne is undergoing a major exercise in addressing accessibility needs across our service experience.

An initial change has been to focus on wayfinding and navigation across our website. We rebuilt our navigation bar and tested using keyboard travel and screen readers.

Outside of our web experience, we’re working on some preliminary workflows and checklists for accessible events.


## Outcomes

### Outcomes for the organization:

A usable web experience has helped the organization maintain customer relationships. This has allowed the organization to experiment with audience interactions. It has also centralized the brand's output, giving the audience something to take pride in.

### Outcomes for users:

-  An integrated customer experience across platforms creates a cohesive awareness of the brand.
-  Faster customer service response times with higher successes.
-  Feedback is implemented more regularly and with speed.



## Project 2

### TEDxMelbourne United: An hybrid event experience to reconnect the artists of the TEDxMelbourne

**Overview:**

In late 2020, TEDxMelbourne introduced a new experience for our community that celebrates the creative and artistic aspects. This event aimed to reconnect the artists of TEDxMelbourne.

**Role:**

-  UI/UI Design and Development
-  Technical Support and Coordination
-  Art Direction Partner

**Outcomes:**

This event introduced our artist pass engagement, an ambitious audience interaction that involved our audience in creating user-generated content. The event also delivered an engaging live experience to both the in-person and online audiences.

You can check out what was created via:

[tedxmelbourne.com/music-salon/artist-catalogue](http://tedxmelbourne.com/music-salon/artist-catalogue)

### Design

**Insights:**

Through preliminary research done by focus groups with consultancy Prime Motive, the TEDxMelbourne audience desires authentic interactions and collaboration in sharing their own TEDx story or message.

**Solutions:**

-  Creating an event that’s central to cultural features of Melbourne, music, arts, creativity.
-  Providing an alternative platform for our audience to express themselves through TEDxMelbourne.
-  Creating a frictionless experience for artists to receive free access to our event while also getting a platform for themselves to share their art.

**Challenges:**

-  Designing and delivering a hybrid (in-person and virtual) music festival.
-  Building a platform and workflow for parsing and optimizing user-generated content.
-  Coordinating secure access for paid online events.

### Mapping and Prototyping

#### User generated content
Creating a system for handling user generated content at scale was a challenge of journey mapping and web development, requiring rigorous testing and coordination. The solution meant that artists could easily submit a profile and once approved, would immediately appear on our site.

#### Web application API Journey for User Generated Content
<Img className="max-w-5xl aspect-auto p-3 lg:p-8 bg-[#F8F8F8]" src="/images/Intergromat-workflow.png" />
The above scenario was built with Integromat. [Watch Video Walkthrough](/writing/automating-graphic-design)

Integromat allowed us to integrate various apps and flows using APIs. Allowing for app like interaction within a low-code environment. If you’re curious to learn more about what is happening in the above, watch my video that talks through it.

### Design

#### Insights
-  Through preliminary research done by focus groups with consultancy Prime Motive, the TEDxMelbourne audience desire authentic interactions and collaboration with sharing their own TEDx story or message. Not everyone can be a speaker. But there can be other ways of expressing this.

#### Solutions
-  Creating an event that’s central to cultural features of Melbourne, music, Arts, Creativity.
-  Providing an alternative platform for our audience to express themselves through TEDxMelbourne.
-  Creating a frictionless experience for artists to receive free access to our event while also getting a platform for themselves to share their art.

#### Challenges
-  Designing and delivering a hybrid (in-person and virtual) music festival.
-  Building a platform and workflow for parsing and optimizing user generated content.
-  Coordinating a secure access for paid online events.

### Hybrid event design
The design of the event required experimentation and collaboration between team members. This space was new for most of us however we were up for the challenge.

 ## Ambiguity calls for alignment
The design of the event required experimentation and collaboration between team members. This space was new for most of us however we were up for the challenge.

To unpack and understand what would be required to run this event, we steps through every part of the event delivery in the form of a service blueprint.

The process of mapping the journey allowed us to test and question aspects of the event, well ahead of the event launch.

### Outcomes

**Outcomes for the organization:**

-  The artist pass catalog accounted for 8% of total unique page views across the TEDxMelbourne domain during Q1 of 2021, and the website saw a website viewership increase of 16%.
-  The organization gained strengths in experimentation, which has led us to push events further.

**Outcomes for users:**

-  The event introduced new ways to engage with TEDxMelbourne and have a platform to be heard.
-  Participants from around the world had the ability to engage with TEDxMelbourne in a more authentic way than ever.
