## Overview
Origin Energy is one of Australia's largest energy retailers. Our team was entrusted to understand the current state of procurement across the organisation and design for their future.

After immediately buying up quick books to learn about [procurement](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B00H1XLBVQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), this project was insightful in getting a window into what drives business across the world. Our team was inspired by the potential to innovate within a compliance and process driven world.

## Product inspiration

While not critical to our design process, our team was eager to get a sense of the technology our client was dealing with and what options exist in the market.
An industry standard is something like [SAP Ariba](https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/procure-to-pay/what-is-procure-to-pay.html#:~:text=Procure%2Dto%2Dpay%20is%20the,Selecting%20goods%20and%20services). Some of our favourites included [ProcurePro](https://procurepro.co/), an Australian construction industry startup, and [ZipHq](https://ziphq.com), a procurement startup based in San Francisco.

## Process

We split the project into two phases: (1) exploring the current state, and (2) defining the future state.

Our deliverables include:
- Current state blueprint of the procurement process.
- Documented findings from user research.
- Low-fidelity conceptual design of concepts.

## Learnings

This project was a valuable learning experience and introduction to a new area for me. The main lesson for our team was understanding how a procurement team can function similarly to an operations team for organisations. 
{/* Rewrite this and improve etc. */}
By collaborating with Origin, we provided insights to their procurement leadership team on real-world challenges they face. In many instances, their team had never experienced walking through their process as a user and were blown away by witnessing some of the pain points.
