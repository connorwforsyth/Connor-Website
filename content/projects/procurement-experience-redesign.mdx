## Overview
Origin Energy is one of Australia's largest energy retailers. And our team was intrusted to understand the current state of procurement and design for their future.

Beyond buying up quick books on [procurement](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B00H1XLBVQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), this project was insightful in getting a window into a big part of what drives business in the world. And our team became inspired by the potential to innovate within a compliance and process driven world.

## Product inspiration

While not critical to our design process, our team was eager to get a sense with the technology our client was dealing with, and what options exist in the market.
An industry standard is something like [SAP Ariba](https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/procure-to-pay/what-is-procure-to-pay.html#:~:text=Procure%2Dto%2Dpay%20is%20the,Selecting%20goods%20and%20services). And some of our favourites in the market include [ProcurePro](https://procurepro.co/) an Australian startup in the contstruction industry and [ZipHq](https://ziphq.com) was our personal favourite.

## Process

We split the project into two phases. (1) exploring the current state (2) defining the future state.

## Learnings

This project was a significant learning curve and entry into a new space for me. But the biggest take away for our team was exploring how a procurement team can operate almost like an operations team for organisations. Through partnering with Origin, we helped their procurement leadership team get a window into the challenges that actually occur on the ground. In several cases, their team didn't
