## Overview

A three person team over four months explored the current state features of the Origin Zero Members Business Portal to address urgent usability issues.

We also looked into the future to explore advanced features for the business portal to help Origin Zero's reach their aspiration for becoming a decarbonisation partner for organisations.

## In total, we delivered:
- A design sprint that helped shape the strategy of the portal.
- A **customer** facing portal and a **broker** portal.
- A review of the information architecture for both portals.
- 10+ Advanced features to help support the future aspirational capabilities.


### Design Sprint Snapshot:

During the design sprint, we focused on getting up to speed with the goals of the business portal and identified critical areas to get right for the initial MVP. This included features like onboarding, simple performance modelling, and configuration options.

The concepts generated in the Design Sprint were tested and prioritised with Origin staff.

## Iteration project
After the initial design sprint, the client established a beta product built with their internal team. After the intial launch, Origin returned to Designit to iterate on their exisiting design work to bring it in line with the aspirations from the sprint.

Here's an overview of what the iteration project achieved.

## Prototype and deliverables

We delivered two separate high-fidelity prototypes that we used for user testing. The two prototypes were designed with different users in-mind. 

Customer portal:
- Designed for direct business customers to manage their own energy assets. Typcical users could be sustainability officers or asset managers.

Broker Portal:
- Designed for specialist energy professionals to manage and oversee various business customers and their assets.

### Concept aspirational features

An additional focus of this project was to identify and explore emerging features of the portal that Origin might explore. We use the term `aspirational features`. Many of the features we explored are services that Origin currently offer, however they are not accessible without a phone call and technician looking up their information. 

These were ideated across one week through collaborating with product owners and engineers to identify which features would be most valuable to explore within the time given.

Because of the inherent complexity of the concepts, we worked closely with origin engineers to visualise the concepts in detail.

## Project playback

I created several playback reels to share the work and research findings with Origin Zero's stakeholders, and an additional video to playback with the Designit internally.

## Learnings
Each of our team members were new to the space of Sustainaiblity and energy, so there was a learning curve when trying to understand and design for concepts such as [Network Tarrif Optiimisation](https://shellenergy.com.au/energy-insights/network-tariff-optimisation-savings/), [EV Fleet Management](https://www.originzero.com.au/energy-solutions/360-ev-e-mobility/), and [Power Factor Correction](https://arc.net/l/quote/jezhtbat). 

Many of these concepts didn't have a pre-existing design pattern that we could leverage as precedents, so coming up with what might be suitable to display and communicate something like power factor was an exciting challenge. 

We leveraged a few precedents from finance product design to communicate realtime changes.
