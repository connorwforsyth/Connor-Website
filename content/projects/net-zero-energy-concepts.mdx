## Overview

A three person team over four months explored the current state features of the Origin Zero Members Business Portal, to address urgent usability issues.

We also looked into the future to explore advanced features for the business portal to match Origin Zero's aspirations for being decarbonisation leader for organisations.

## In total, we explored:
- A **customer** facing portal and a **broker** portal.
- A review of the information architecture for both portals.
- 10+ Advanced features to help support the future aspirational capabilities.

## Background
This project was a continuation from a design sprint that we conducted with Origin Zero that kickstarted their initial iteration of the MBP (Members Business Portal).

During the design sprint, we focused on getting up to speed with the goals of the business portal, and identified some critical things to get right for an initial MVP of the platform. Such as onboarding, simple performance modelling, and some configuration options.

These concepts were intitially tested with Origin staff.

## Learnings
Each of our team members were new to the space of Sustainaiblity and energy, so there was a learning curve when trying to understand and design for concepts such as [Network Tarrif Optiimisation](https://shellenergy.com.au/energy-insights/network-tariff-optimisation-savings/), [EV Fleet Management](https://www.originzero.com.au/energy-solutions/360-ev-e-mobility/), and [Power Factor Correction](https://arc.net/l/quote/jezhtbat). 

Many of these concepts didn't have a pre-existing design pattern that we could leverage as precidencts, so coming up with what might be suitable to display and communicate something like power factor was an exciting challenge. 

We leveraged a few precidents from finance product design to communicate realtime changes.
