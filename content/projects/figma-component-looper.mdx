## Overview

By accepting a string of text separated by line breaks, the plugin creates instances of the selected component.

This is suitable if you have many component instances to create or edit, and you don't want to go one-by-one editing each individually.

You can also replace text in selected instances and specify which variable you wish to replace.

This workflow reduces context switching and dramatically speeds up efficiency for designers while adding content to their components instances.

## Hidden features

- Sound feedback on component generation
- Intentional positioning of generated instances taking into account parent frames and sections.

## Origin

The idea of this plugin came from attempting to quickly shift sticky notes from a Miro board to a Figma component. Suitable for quickly polishing workshop outputs.
