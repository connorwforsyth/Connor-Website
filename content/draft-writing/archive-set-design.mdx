"What is the project that you are most proud of?"
Whenever I get asked this question, this project emerges to the surface of my mind. I then smile, and quickly try come up with something that is more relevant to what I do today.

Whenever I get asked the question: "What is the project I'm most proud of?

This project often emerges in my mind, then smile and quickly try come up with something that's is more relevant to what I do today.

This 10+ year old YouTube footage may be all that's left from the project. And it represents my first glimmering moment of blissful joy when I've created something satisfyingly inspiring.

When I went into the process of projection mapping, I had no idea where to begin, I mustered up finding a classroom projector, opened up Photoshop 2010, set the aspect ratio of the projector to match the canvas, and attempted to start tracing my hand cut model of a set.

What this project represents to me, was a key moment in which I was totally immersed in the process of creating something.

It represents a time in which I knew not what I was doing, wasn't overly concerned with direction but only wanted to create something that made people open their eyes and say Wow.

It's also a project in which the creation process required true creativity and problem solving, no experts, only strong curiosity.

I have fond memories, not sleeping and driving to my high school at dawn to celebrate the sunrise with my fellow classmates, who similarly did not sleep in order to push their projects to their limits.

I hope all people get moments to celebrate their own version of this tasteful satisfaction through their careers.

> Deep state of mind, obsession of detail and perfection. Energised by inching ahead to greatness

> Satisfying mark of a job well done
> Satisfyingly blissful exhaustion.
> Satisfying drunken daze of completed project
