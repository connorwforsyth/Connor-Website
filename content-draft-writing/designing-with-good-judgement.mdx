Ever since the [Ruby on Rails Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDKUEXBF3B4) from Honeypot, I've been keeping an eye on the team at 37 signals and what they've been sharing.

In their recent Rework podcast [It's all a judgement call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftSO2ufbgps) I've been reflecting on what it means to make quick decisions as designers.

> Designers, have an innate abiity to use their gut to embody a whole host of perspectives and ideas. We often forget to tap into that instinct and intution.
